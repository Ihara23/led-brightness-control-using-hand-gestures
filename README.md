# led-brightness-control-using-hand-gestures

This project demonstrates how to control the brightness of an LED using hand gestures.

HandTracking module was used so that tracks all points on the hand and detects hand landmarks, calculate the distance between thumb tip and index fingertip and maps the distance between thumb tip and index fingertip which converts to different levels of brightness range. Led brightness was controlled by integrating serial communication with arduino and python.

### Requirements
